# 3rd party API weather app

## Description
The following project creates a basic weather search app using Jquery,bootstrap,moment, google fonts and openweather APIs. The current search will render in recent search history and allow you to click any item within that list to launch a new search. 

While in the beginning this project presented itself as straight forward and simple, I found it offered a few fun challenges to over come by forcing me to learn new ways to solve problems.

 

## Mock Up and screenshots
